# Git Commit Auto (with Gemini AI)

This script, `git-commit-auto`, automatically generates a conventional commit message for your staged changes using the Gemini AI and then executes the commit.

This allows you to run `git commit-auto` instead of `git commit -m "..."`.


## Dependencies

You must have the following command-line tools installed:

- `git`

- `curl` (for making API requests)

- `jq` (for parsing the API response)

You can typically install `curl` and `jq` using your system's package manager (like `apt`, `yum`, `brew`, or `pacman`).


## Setup Instructions

1. **Get a Gemini API Key:**

   - Go to Google AI Studio (or Google Cloud Console) and create an API key.

2. **Set Environment Variable:**

   - You need to securely store this API key as an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

   - Add the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`):

     ```
     export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
     ```

   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.

   - Reload your shell for the change to take effect (e.g., by running `source ~/.bashrc` or just opening a new terminal).

3. **Install the Script:**

   - Save the `git-commit-auto.sh` script from the previous file.

   - Rename it to just `git-commit-auto` (no `.sh` extension).

   - Make it executable:

     ```
     chmod +x git-commit-auto
     ```

   - Move it to a directory that is in your system's `PATH`. A common place is `/usr/local/bin`:

     ```
     sudo mv git-commit-auto /usr/local/bin/
     ```

     (You can also use a directory in your home, like `~/bin`, if you have that in your `PATH`).


## How to Use

From now on, your workflow will be:

1. Make your code changes.

2. Stage your changes as usual:

   ```
   git add .
   ```

   _(or `git add <file1> <file2>...`)_

3. Instead of `git commit`, just run:

   ```
   git commit-auto
   ```

The script will show you the message it generated and then perform the commit.

**Note:** Git automatically recognizes executables in your `PATH` that are named `git-xyz` as Git subcommands. That's why running `git commit-auto` works!
